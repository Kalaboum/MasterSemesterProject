\section{Conclusion}

Previous work on smoothed complexity of local max-cut has given the insight that it may be polynomial for arbitrary graphs. Actually the bound is quasi-polynomial \cite{etscheid2017smoothed} for arbitrary graphs, and polynomial for complex graphs \cite{angel2016local}. Using a simple proof for the complexity of graphs with log degrees, we extended the proof of complete graphs to graphs containing both cliques and log degrees vertices. We have shown different proofs for multiple classes of graphs, the last one at section \ref{strongResult} being the stronger result since it includes the other classes. \\
The proof relies on the very high connectivity of cliques on one hand, on the very low connectivity between different components on the other hand. The classes of graphs that seem to be troublesome are the ones with high connectivity without being complete, e.g. the expander graphs. On the expander graphs it will be hard to discretize the influence of non-moving vertices, it is thus an interesting class to investigate. \\
